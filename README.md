Simple Versioning Specification (SimVer) 1.0 [WiP ATM]

# Spec

1. Keep a proper changelog (e.g. the “[Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)” format).
2. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR, _on release_, increment the:
   1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes.
   2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, or make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

## about “incompatible API changes”

MAJOR does not need to be a factor if you’ve properly deprecated something.

MAJOR does not need to be a factor if you’ve added, updated, removed, or promoted an experimental feature.
